## Hypothesis Testing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## CPS Library Pull

```{r}
library(probstats4econ)
cps%>%filter(statefips%in%c("VT","CA"))%>%glimpse()

```

```{r}
vt_ca <- cps %>%
  filter(statefips %in% c("VT", "CA"))
```

## One Sided T-test

```{r}
t.test(age ~ statefips,
       data = vt_ca,
       alternative = "greater")
```

::: textbox
**t value:** indicates that the mean of data set "ca" (California) is lower than that of data set "vt" (Vermont).

**p-value:** the value is high indicating that there is a high chance the null hypothesis is true.

**alternative hypothesis:** the test was run to see if the result of ca-vt was less than or equal to 0, and a negative difference would indicate that the mean of ca is less than vt.

## Box and Whisker Plot

```{r}
vt <- vt_ca$age[vt_ca$statefips == "VT"]

boxplot(vt,
        main = "Vermont Age Distribution",
        ylab = "Age",
        xlab = "")  # empty x-axis label


```

\<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD \## Confidence Intervals

```{r}
ca <- vt_ca$age[vt_ca$statefips == "CA"]

boxplot(ca,
        main = "California Age Distribution",
        ylab = "Age",
        xlab = "")

```

## Confidence Intervals

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Your values:
diff_mean <- 44.51026 - 45.30556   # difference in means
se_diff <-  (3.781076) / 1.96      # approximate standard error from CI width (CI width / 1.96 for 95%)
                                  # Note: This assumes symmetric CI, so adjust if not symmetric

# Define 95% CI bounds (using your lower bound and an upper bound for plotting)
ci_lower <- diff_mean - 1.96 * se_diff
ci_upper <- diff_mean + 1.96 * se_diff

# Create a sequence of x values over a reasonable range
x <- seq(diff_mean - 4 * se_diff, diff_mean + 4 * se_diff, length.out = 200)

# Calculate normal density values for these x
y <- dnorm(x, mean = diff_mean, sd = se_diff)

# Put into a data frame
df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

# Plot with shaded 95% confidence interval
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(data = subset(df, x >= ci_lower & x <= ci_upper), aes(ymin = 0, ymax = y), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Normal Distribution of Difference in Means with 95% CI",
    x = "Difference in Means (CA - VT)",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
