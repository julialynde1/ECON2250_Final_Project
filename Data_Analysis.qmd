## Hypothesis Testing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## CPS Library Pull

```{r}
library(probstats4econ)
cps%>%filter(statefips%in%c("VT","CA"))%>%glimpse()

```

```{r}
vt_ca <- cps %>%
  filter(statefips %in% c("VT", "CA"))
```

## One Sided T-test

```{r}
t.test(age ~ statefips,
       data = vt_ca,
       alternative = "greater")
```

::: textbox
This is my trying the textbook.

**t value:** indicates that the mean of data set "ca" (California) is lower than that of data set "vt" (Vermont).

**p-value:** the value is high indicating that there is a high chance the null hypothesis is true.

**alternative hypothesis:** the test was run to see if the result of ca-vt was less than or equal to 0, and a negative difference would indicate that the mean of ca is less than vt.
