## Research Topic:

**Average age of residents in different regions of the United States**

## Subject, Motivation, & Research Question:

**Subject**:

::: textbox
Average age of workforce eligible residents of Vermont and California.
:::

**Motivation:**

::: textbox
Our topic ties into urbanization, as California is the most urbanized state (94.2%) while Vermont is the least (35.1%). We want to see how urbanization may affect the average age of residents in a state. The average age of the workforce in a given state can also give insights into the economic conditions of the area, as an aging workforce can lower productivity and result in a shrinking workforce.

**Research Question:**

::: textbox
Is the average age of Vermont higher than that of California? Null hypothesis: VT (age) ≥ CA (age)
