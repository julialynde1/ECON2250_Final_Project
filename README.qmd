## Project Description

Our project analyzes the **average age of workforce eligible residents of Vermont and California**. This research explores **urbanization**, provided that California is substantially more urbanized relative to Vermont. We hypothesize that such differences in urbanization are reflected in the workforce age distribution. Specifically, we expect the average age of workforce eligibile population to be greater in Vermont relative to Vermont **(our null hypothesis)**. Such a hypothesis calls for a **one-sided T-test**. We are driven to such research in an effort to gain further insight into the economic conditions of different states. Fundamentally, a higher average age of an eligibile workforce population can indicate an aging population, a shrinking workforce, and slowed prodcutivity. Such conditions, on a broader level, can letter connect to **broader macroeconomic principles** such as human capital capacity and GDP.

## Outline & Breakdown of Our Project

Our primary project work and data analysis can be found in **Project.Rproj.qmd**

This file contains our **hypothesis testing**, and was where we were able to determine whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis**.** Here, you can finding the following information:

**Break down of each of the following is below:**

**CPS Library Pull:**

::: {#CPS Library Pull .textbox style="color: purple"} **What is this?**

*The data for our project is stored within an R Library. This data set can be found isolated in our "data" folder in data.qmd. To collect the data we needed for this project, we filtered the data set by two states: CA and VT**.** This data set provided us with 377 rows and 17 columns of information.* :::

**One-Sided Test:**

::: {#T-Test .textbox style="color: purple"}
**What is a one-sided Test?**

*For a one-sided test of an unknown parameter, the null and alternative hypothesis are H0: Theta \>= c, & H1: Theta \< c, respectively. The hypothesis test of H0 determines whether there is statistical evidence to reject H0.*

**Why was this appropriate for our research?**

*Provided that we are seeking to compare two different values—the average age of a workforce eligible population–this is more appropriate than a two-sided test. For a two-sided test, the null hypothesis is instead H0: theta = c, and the alternative hypothesis is H1 != c. This form of testing is not appropriate given our research topic.*

**How did we conduct the T-Test?**

*To create the T-test we created the variable "vt_ca" by filtering data from the CPS data set given. We then ran a t test in R using the null hypothesis stating that difference in means when calculating California minus Vermont would be less than 0, indicating that the mean age in California is less than that of Vermont. The alternative hypothesis was that the difference would be greater than 0. This test also gave us the p-value, t-value, means of the data set, and the other necessary descriptive statistics.*
:::

**Box and Whisker Plots:**

::: {#Box style="color: purple"}
**What box and whisker plots did we have?**

*We have 2 box and whisker plots, one showing the age distribution of the workforce eligible population of Vermont and the other showing the age distribution of the workforce eligible population of California.*

**How did we create the box and whisker plots?**

*We created the box and whisker plots using the CPS data, with California and Vermont being on 2 separate plots. The y-axis of both plots is age while the x-axis is empty.*

**What did the box & whisker plots tells us?**

*The box and whisker plots show that California has a more evenly spread age distribution with a lower mean. The IQR of California also appears smaller, indicating the residents of the state who are workforce eligible is more centralized. The box and whisker plot for Vermont shows a more skewed distribution, with the third quartile being smaller than the first quartile. This indicates there is a larger population of older workforce eligible residents in this state compared to younger ones.*
:::

**Confident Intervals:**

::: {#CI's .textbox style="color: purple"} **What are confidence intervals?**

*An interval of possible values for a parameter based on an estimator.*

*A 95% confidence interval for a parameter is an interval for which, before observing the sample, there is 95% probability that the parameter is in the interval created by the estimation procedure.*
