## Outline & Breakdown of Our Project

Our primary project work and data analysis can be found in **Project.Rproj.qmd**

This file contains our **hypothesis testing**, and was where we were able to determine whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis**.** Here, you can finding the following information:

::: textbox
1.  CPS Library Pull 2. One-Sided T-Test 3. Box and Whisker Plots 4. Confidence Intervals 5. T-Distribution Plot w/ Critical Value

**Break down of each of the following is below:**

**CPS Library Pull:**

::: textbox
**What is this?**

The data for our project is stored within an R Library. This data set can be found isolated in our "data" folder in data.qmd. To collect the data we needed for this project, we filtered the data set by two states: **CA and VT**. This data set provided us with 377 rows and 17 columns of information.

**One-Sided Test:**

::: {#T-Test .textbox style="color: purple"}
**What is a one-sided Test?**

*For a one-sided test of an unknown parameter, the null and alternative hypothesis are H0: Theta \>= c, & H1: Theta \< c, respectively. The hypothesis test of H0 determines whether there is statistical evidence to reject H0.*

**Why was this appropriate for our research?**

*Provided that we are seeking to compare two different values—the average age of a workforce eligible population–this is more appropriate than a two-sided test. For a two-sided test, the null hypothesis is instead H0: theta = c, and the alternative hypothesis is H1 != c. This form of testing is not appropriate given our research topic.*

**How did we conduct the T-Test?**

*To conduct the t-test we isolated the Vermont and California CPS data and creates a variable "vt_ca". The t-test was ran with the null hypothesis that the difference in means between California and Vermont was less than 0, which would indicate that the mean age of Vermont is greater than that of California. The alternative hypothesis was "greater".*

**Box and Whisker Plots:**

::: {.textbox style="color: purple"}
**What box and whisker plots did we have?**

*We used two box and whisker plots, one representing the age distribution in California and the other representing the age distribution in Vermont.*

**How did we create the box and whisker plots?**

*We created the box and whisker plots in R by isolating the Vermont and California age data. Each plot only has the data from one state. The y-axis shows the age of residents while the x-axis is unlabeled as each plot only measures one variable.*

**What did the box & whisker plots tells us?**

*The box and whisker plots show the overall age distribution of each state. The California plot shows that the mean age is slightly lower than that of Vermont, and the IQR is more compressed indicating a more even distribution. The Vermont plot is more skewed towards older ages, indicating there are more residents around and above the mean age given.*
